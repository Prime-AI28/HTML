It was a mesmerizing experience where we did a lot of hard work in making our models for this event. We saw people of different cultures and knowledge which they shared with us. It also helped us by teaching us our responsibilities.
We were  thankfull to ATL, Ryan International School and our ATL in charge as they were very supportive and encouraged us a lot. We also decided that we would work harder for next time and ensure some trophies for our school
