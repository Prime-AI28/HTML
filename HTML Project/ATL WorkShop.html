Understanding the need of the hour, Ryan International School, Faridabad came up with yet another Tinkerer's Workshop, conducted , from 21st May' 18 to 02nd June'18.
In the session, while getting equipped with Electronics, Arduino programming & 3D-Printing skills through hands-on approach students designed and implemented their own line follower Robot, aimed to autonomously detect and follow a particular black line path.

In order to take their learnings to yet another level, these young enthusiasts are now determined to expand the Bot's features so that it's utilities & application can be broadened to solve industrial & social issues.</p>
	<p>Great learning experience by tinkering students ,participated in various events Roborace,Water Rocket ,Line follower 
Also shared working with Mentor of change ,Dr.Babulal -Director BHEL</p>

Ryan Faridabad Technocrats of class VIII â€“XI attended a one day workshop on awareness and implementation of Biotech kit.

The Students enthusiastically learnt about Arduino microcontroller which is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on the computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

They were told about the features of arduino controller with practical implementation of arduino software which was able to rotate from 0 to 180 degree and vice versa. They had hand on experience session where they attached the biotech kit elements and wrote the program to run the application such as message printing,door lock encoding.They also explored LiquidCrystal Library library which allows an Arduino board to control LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 or a compatible chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs. The library works with in either 4- or 8-bit mode. They wrote programs to display messages on liquid crystal display in various formats.

They also learnt about Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library all-in-one optical fingerprint sensor will make adding fingerprint detection and verification super simple. 
These modules are typically used with a high powered DSP chip that does the image rendering, calculation, feature-finding and searching and can be connected to any microcontroller or system with TTL serial, and send packets of data to take photos, detect prints, hash and searching. The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, and for good reason. 
The students were made aware about the two websites instructables.com and huckster.com where they can explore about project in different ATL dimensions. The workshop was indeed an enriching experience for the students and teachers as it gave new dimensions to explore the Biotechnology world.</p>
