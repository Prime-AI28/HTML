<p>"Our future growth relies on competitiveness an innovation, skills and productivity
	and these in turn rely on the education of our people”</p>
	<p style="text-align:right;">-Julia Gillard</p><br>
<p>With the introduction of ATL we were introduced to a completely new way of education. ATL not only included theoretical knowledge but also gave us a chance to practice what we have learnt by making working models of the same.<img src="My Story/Me2.JPG" height="250" width="575" align="left"> We were also able to integrate our knowledge and make prototypes of models of some of our innovative solutions and participated in various competitions. Numerous workshops were also conducted to increase our understanding about various micro-controllers, sensors, Arduino Board, NXT kit and their coding. We worked on many projects which include various marathons and competitions for which we made numberless projects.<img src="My Story/Me3.JPG" height="200" width="500" align="right"> 
First significant project which we made was “The Cleaning Bot”. We had a team which worked upon for a month and we sent it for ATL Marathon. It basically aims to work as a social welfare bot also it aims accomplish our honourable Prime Minister “Narendra Modi’s” dream of Clean India. We also attended workshops for Arduino and Cloud Computing. We even celebrated ATL Community Day in which we invited many NGOs and government schools and did a lot of creative activities where they put their brains in creating something innovative projects.<img src="My Story/Me5.JPG" height="200" width="450" align="left"> 
We went to various government schools and shared our knowledge with them we also showed them our project and explained its working to them, we gave them some projects to create and shared some social problems for which we asked them to brainstorm and come up with answer. 
I also worked on NXT projects and made bot which has multiple sensor attached to it which makes it so special. 
	<img src="My Story/Me1.JPG" height="300" width="350" align="right">It can sense a line, can be controlled by voice and also it can find its own way. We made a tool for smart irrigation methods to increase productivity and decrease water wastage. We went to an international competition wherein I participated in three
	<img src="My Story/Me4.JPG" height="400" width="300" align="left">competitions for which we made three projects- “Water Rocket”, “Line Follower” and “A remote controlled bot for Robo Race”. Since the starting we have been working on various projects to save our wildlife and so we made a train accident preventing System which had an LCD display, IR sensor’s and Arduino attached to it. 
We have attended various workshop which included courses for electric circuit making, 3-d model designing, solar cell projects and many more. We have also been guided to use bio-tech kit, Water sanitation kit Agri-tech kit, gear kit and many more.
We are really thanked to ATL to give us this opportunity</p>
